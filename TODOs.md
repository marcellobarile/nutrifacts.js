- Improve the handling of cooking weights and measures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_weights_and_measures)
- There are common foods that are often misleaded. (eggs = bottarga mullet roe eggs, salt = salt cod)
- Check values for "unitMeasuresInGrams" (both IT and EN)
- Move units to the DB instead of having JSON files
- Support {int} {unit} {fraction} (e.g. 1 gram and 1/2)
- When the unit is missing (e.g. 1 banana) find and use the average weight in grams of such ingredient
- How to deal with missing foods in the DB? The optimal solution would be to derive the most generic available food (e.g. "guanciale" => "pork fat meat")
